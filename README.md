# ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** The web application is compatible with PolygonID mobile app v1.0.3

During the creation of this platform, [`@iden3/js-iden3-auth`](https://github.com/iden3/js-iden3-auth/tree/v0.1.6) was in `v0.1.6`, and PolygonID mobile app was at `v1.0.3`. Due to the recent changes in Iden3 circuits, and Polygon ID mobile app shifting from a custom claim format to a W3C Verifiable Credentials, the web application is incompatible in recent times.

**But,** we are actively working on it! Track our progress here ✨ [**#38**](https://github.com/jagnani73/ethforall-delinzk/issues/38)

# 💡 **Problem Statement**

The problem with the current networking platform is that it allows individuals to register under an organization, claiming a specific tenure without any platform verification or proof from the said organization. This lack of validation leads to inaccurate and misleading information being presented on the platform, making it difficult for users to trust the platform and make informed decisions based on the information available.

# 🧠 **Knowledge Primer**

- An _Employee_ is an individual who is working, or has worked for an organization.
- An _Organization_ is an entity that is either looking for an _Employee_ or has some employed.
- An _Admin_ is an envoy of **deLinZK**.

# 📦 **Inside the box**

deLinZK is a platform that specializes in providing advanced verification services to organizations and their employees. The platform uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs using PolygonID and its Self-Sovereign Identity policies to allow

- organizations to verify their legitimacy
- employees to verify their tenure in an organization.

deLinZK acts as an issuer of the claims made by an organization for them being verified on deLinZK and a verifier of the claims made by an employee for their tenure at an organization. This ensures a more reliable and **trusted networking** application.
